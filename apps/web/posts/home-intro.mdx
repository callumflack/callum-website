I’m a designer and frontend engineer with over 20 years of experience.

From vision to details and back again, my job is to build beautifully designed hypertext interfaces that work in the blink of an eye, creating the most valued currency—trust.

I also write about what I know (and don't know). It's a good way to keep in touch, so you should [signup for new posts](https://thelittoralline.substack.com/).
