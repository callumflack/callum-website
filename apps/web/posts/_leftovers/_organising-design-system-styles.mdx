## Atomic CSS just works until it doesn't

A decade ago, CSS was hard. Immature methods, tooling and browsers led to wildfire situations as website grew. Hidden costs such as the infamous [4095 selector limit in IE](https://github.com/markstory/asset_compress/issues/162) were common. A slew of [experimental](https://smacss.com/) [ideas](https://suitcss.github.io/) attempted to solve the problem of scaling and modularising CSS architecture by either "atomising" CSS into single-purpose style classes or rigorous [naming](https://getbem.com/) methods or both.

Fast forward to now and Tailwind has won by providing developers with an atomic CSS system that is both easy to learn and configure. We can now import Tailwind and start styling HTML or components in minutes. No need to manage your backpack of Sass mixins, think about class naming or worry about the CSS cascade.

Defaults are fantastic ways to advance systems. Zero config "it just works" libraries like Tailwind are the [infrastructure pace layer](https://jollycontrarian.com/index.php?title=Pace_layering) that creates more time for building. If that's what you need, don't read any further—the default CSS from Tailwind is more than fine. But if you're scaling an app, and it needs to look good, then the governance layer underneath your infrastructure tools requires attention.
