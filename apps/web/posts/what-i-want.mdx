### TLDR

This post is to help recruiters, hiring managers, colleagues and myself to get a better idea of the kind of work I'm good at and that I enjoy.

The short version: A job where reliability and performance is important, at scale. Ideally remote. No tiny startups. No gambling, predatory fintech, or blockchain. I value leadership, teams.

## What I do

I'm a design engineer and product leader. Learn about me [here](/about). Here's [my CV](/CallumFlackCV2024.pdf).

**Code is my design tool.** Design is my first love. I spent over a decade working in branding and graphic design. I taught myself to code because it was the only way to effect the outcomes I had in mind. Now I use code as a design tool to get as close as possible to the web browser. Being able to design and code simply creates a much faster feedback loop.

**I love building UI.** I love making the user interface real in terms of what makes a valuable customer experience. For example, app performance, async data management and thoughtful data schemas are as much the basis for good UI as the visual, interactive experience. One cannot work without the other.

**More than the sum of parts.** It looks good in Figma, but how does it feel as a coded UI? It may fulfil spec, but does it feel fast? There are no answers to these questions without continuously drafting until it feels right. Delivery is not code commits, it's a tangible experience in the hands of real people. I enjoy owning this process.

**AI makes design (and taste) even more important.** I think LLMs will shift the role of software engineer from author to reviewer. This means there is going to be more time to think deeply about ideas, opportunities and testing them. Scripting, APIs, monorepos and design systems can all be configured now with this future in mind. I'm very interested in working on these problems.

## I do this with teams

**People first.** Great products are built by teams. Working together with great people creates a context of knowhow that is very difficult to replicate. I know the limits of my capabilities and I'm not afraid to ask questions. Disagreement, being wrong. Small teams are best because there's less communication overhead, more velocity.

**Tempo.** Knowing and defining the tempo is crucial. Are we planning or executing? Are we in maintainence or researching? A sense of urgency helps carve out the true nature of scope. Being pragmatic at every step helps balance craft with delivery.

**Communication plays a big part.** How the team is oriented around mission helps make task work smooth and meaningful. If we disagree, we should accept and commit to the decision. Strong opinions, weakly held. Personally, I write or video demo my progress at the end of most days.

**Listening leadership.** The best manager I've had would, when I had the floor, listen closely, query for understanding, rephrase what I'd said in his own words, then take a few seconds and give me a direct answer. I was always so happy to work with him.

## The right fit

I’m open to exploring opportunities ranging from well defined one-off projects to joining a team. This could involve design-engineering (or either design or engineering individually), a product role, or advising/consulting on projects that overlap between technology, culture, and publishing.

**I'm in Australia on the AEST timezone.** I live with my family in Cairns. I've worked remotely in Cairns since 2015 for clients across Australia, and for two US-based start-ups. The 4 hour US-AUS timezone overlap works quite well for daily schedules.

**Rates**. My base compensation for joining a funded team is approximately ~$180k/year, and my base day rate is ~$1.6k, whether for commissioned work or consulting/advising. Each situation is unique, and exceptions are possible.
